# Grocery Management System

This project was developed as part of the **CSE370: Database Systems** course. It is a web-based grocery management system where an admin can view and manage data related to employees, customers, inventory, items, expiry tracking, and payment methods. The system is built using **PHP**, **MySQL**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and a bit of **JavaScript**, and it runs locally on **XAMPP**.

> ⚠️ This was a team project developed 2–3 years ago from when it was published. The main purpose of this project was to showcase the MySQL database knowledge only. The code may slightly differ from the final screenshots. Some errors may exist. GitHub was not used during collaboration — we worked via direct file sharing and communication. This was the first project in the Web Development field.
