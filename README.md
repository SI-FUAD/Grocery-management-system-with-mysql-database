# Grocery Management System

This project was developed as part of the **CSE370: Database Systems** course. It is a web-based grocery management system where an admin can view and manage data related to employees, customers, inventory, items, expiry tracking, and payment methods.

The system was built using **PHP**, **MySQL**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and some **JavaScript**, and is designed to run locally using **XAMPP**.

> ⚠️ This was a university team project completed approximately 2–3 years before this publication. It was primarily created to demonstrate knowledge of **MySQL database systems**. GitHub was not used at the time; collaboration was done through lab work and direct communication. Some code may differ slightly from the screenshots provided in the report. Minor inconsistencies or errors may exist, as this was our first web development project.
